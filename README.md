## 🏗️ Architecture & Technologies

The system is built on **AWS Serverless** architecture for scalability and low maintenance.

| Component | AWS Service | Purpose |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Frontend** | S3 + CloudFront | Hosting the React SPA (Single Page Application) |
| **Auth** | Cognito | User Identity, Authentication, and RBAC (Roles) |
| **API** | API Gateway | REST Endpoint management for Frontend-Backend communication |
| **Compute** | Lambda (Python) | Business logic for API requests and IoT event processing |
| **IoT** | IoT Core | MQTT Broker for real-time device communication |
| **Database** | DynamoDB | NoSQL storage for Users, Devices, and Sessions |
| **Alerts** | SNS | Push notifications (Email) for "Water Ready" alerts |
